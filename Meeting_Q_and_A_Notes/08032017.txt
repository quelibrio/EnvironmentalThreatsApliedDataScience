Hypothesis Selection
	- Clear majority for 1st 
		- Predicting where pollution will end up
	
	- No clear 2nd
		- Tool for visualising datasets
		- Finding relationships between water quaility and flood datasets
		- Predicting the river level
		
The next steps 
	- Need more understanding of the water quailty
		- Payam to find which water quaility measurements are high - Due Wednesday
	- Actually get dataset
		- Carlo to develop script - Due Wednesday
		- Guy to get and understand catchment area data - Due Wednesday
	- Generate ideas as to how to solve hypothesis
		- Frank to research ideas - Due Wednesday
	- Do we need a DB?
		- May be able to get away with reading and writing files
	- Improve current visualisation
		- Martin to start improving orginal visualisations
			
Potential Idea
	- We know the level of water before and after rainfall, we can visualise the river levels when it didn't rain for a week and see how the water changes over time.
		
Next Meeting
