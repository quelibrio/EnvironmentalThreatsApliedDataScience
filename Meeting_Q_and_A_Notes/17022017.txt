Notes from Q&A session 17/02/2017

	- Questions for EA meeting
		- What do they want?
		- Is it Defra or the EA?
			- Defra - Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
		- Is the data theirs?
		
	- Things to think about
		- Meaning
		- Hypothesis for efficieny
		- Can we come up with an answer to one or several hypothesis to the environment agency?
		- Initutions about how they use the sensors
		- A tour of the data
			- What sort of actions do they take based on the data?
		- Try your hypothesis as you work on the problem
		
	- Big Questions	
		- Can you use the sensors more efficiently?
		- How do you measure efficiency of a sensor?
		
	- Hypothesis
		- If we take away one sensor do we still get the same efficiency, or if we take away x sensors do we still get the same flood warnings?
		- If we remove sensors that are closer together we still get the same efficiency.
			- Could do this with flood data by weighting based on chance of flood warning, reorganise all the sensors and see the recalculated weights are better.
	
	- Session with environment agency
		- Chris - a manager in the data knowledge team
		- Tony - innovation lead
		
	- Kick off the discussion
		- Talk about their data
			- Come with as many questions as possible about it?
			- How to measure if a sensor is efficient?
			- If they have a preference over which data to study?
			- What do they want out of this, software etc?
			- What fields are important when measuring efficiency?
		- What do we want out of this?
