Discussed how to solve 'Predicting where pollution will end up' hypothesis

Possibilities
	- Labelling of data
		- If DEFRA has no labels for data, we have 2 options:
			- Come up with labels ourselves
			- Use unsupervised learning, potentially to separate stations into groups by clustering
	
	- Check whether if you would expect to see pollution in general
		- Possible places to explore would be near Sellafield (Cumbria, Location of Nuclear power plants) or Thames Area (see https://www.gov.uk/government/news/thames-water-ordered-to-pay-record-20-million-for-river-pollution)
		- Could be used for feature selection
	
	- Merge the features
		- Could determine causality
	
	- Could use Naive Bayes
	
How to approach the problem
	- Simplify
		- Check for the correlations between time series
			- If two stations are close together they should have a high correlation
			- Expect smoothness
			- Try to spot those that have a different assumption
			
	- One possible approach
		- Build a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) of a river to identify stations that are close together
		- Plot time series of the stations that are close together and see if they are correlated	
			- Potentially use clustering of time series to identify similar points
		- Use machine learning to predict where pollution will end up
