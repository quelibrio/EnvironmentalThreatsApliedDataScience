Attendees
	- Guy

	- Martin
	
Summary of the previous meeting
	- Are we monitoring in the right places for the right times
	- We have the data skills to find this out
	
	- Are others doing the same monitoring the EA do know about
		- e.g. Bristol City Council, there is pretty much no cooperation

Defra
	- Collection of government organisations including EA, Forestry Commission etc.
	- Each organisation can be blinkered
	- It could be that others are doing the same thing
	- Questions
		- Are the EA monitoring the right things in the right places
		- Could a similar amount of data be monitoring the same thing
	- The EA do not know if they are doing good monitoring
	
Project
	- Deliverables
		- There is nothing specific the EA want to us to work on
		
	- What is in it for the EA?
		- Find out interesting things
		- Try and find interesting things
		- The question is vague for a reason
		- We should try not to lose this opportunity
		- It would be nice to learn something different
		
	- Ideas
		- Is there a better way of representing the data
			- May want to create another map with circles and numbers
		- Look at river quaility in relation to river levels
			- Are those points similar or are they different?
				- Almost start asking questions to that
		- Plot factories/farms on a map
			- What does this tell us?
			- Should the EA put more monitoring close to big factories/farms?
			- If it is bad why?
		- Use something to pull other data together that is interesting
		
	- Data
		- Rainfall API in Flood API
			- Comparing rainfall with water quaility
			- Comparing river level with water quailty
	
	- Notes
		- Analysis may create insights
		- If we want to go outside the box then feel free to
		- Important to choose the right areas
			- e.g. River levels will go up and down in different areas
			- Quality measures
		- Able to set objectives
		- Our idea about the correlation between rainfall and water level is almost obvious
			- The EA are doing work in this area at the moment
			- The EA would find it more interesting to look at river quailty in relation to river levels
		- Sensors may all be in the same/similar places
		- Not a good idea to compare river level in rainfall data
		- Have a look at wunderground (https://www.wunderground.com/) 
			- A weather website created by amauteur weather people
			- Can pull in their data if needed
		- Do not necessarily regard the question as how the EA can improvement monitoring
		- We might be able to draw some real assoications
		- Do not feel restricted, choose an area that is interesting
			- Whatever we do is likely to be of interest to the EA
		- May be a useful exercise to catergorise and label data
