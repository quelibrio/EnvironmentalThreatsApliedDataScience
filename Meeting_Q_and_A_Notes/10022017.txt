Notes from Q&A Session and meeting 10/02/2017

Think about Goals for the project.

Output - A report due 05/05/2017
	   - A presentation
       - A system to do data science

Ambition should be to get a really good mark - possibly part of your CV.
	   
Team members should work approximately 1 / 2 days per week on this project.

Teams should nominate a spokesperson - Guy

The report should follow a template - a description of the problem, how we solved it and the outcome.

Dan Schein sees no reason not to open source.

The team should have a shared ambition of what you want to get out of it.

Dan Schein recommends using Python for data analysis because of 
	- ipython notebooks
	- building tools
	- pycharm - ide
	- if using ipython notebooks, clear all images before checking into source control.
	
Project - Monitoring
	- sensors are set up at certain locations in the U.K and are very expensive
	- Project could be on how to analyse the sensors or how to utilise all of them, what kind of things do they need
	- One angle to look it is can we reduce the number of sensors and still get the similar data quailtiy

Problem Steps
	- Data Collection and Storing
	- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
	- Data Analysis
	- Data Visualisation and Reporting

Project Management will be done using trello
    - need to set up template



First Tasks
Open and explore Data in Python
	- Water Quality - Payam
	- Flood - Frank
	- Spatial Data - Martin

Analyse existing Data Visualisation tools - Carlo

Set up trello - Guy

Organise meeting with environment agency - Guy
